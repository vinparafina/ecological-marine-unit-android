# Ecological Marine Unit Explorer Android

This repo is home to the [ArcGIS Ecological Marine Unit (EMU)](https://developers.arcgis.com/example-apps/ecological-marine-unit-android/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=example_apps_emu_android) example application.  The app uses the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/) to showcase ocean ecosystems.  
Explore 50 years worth of NOAA data using Esri maps and services!

## Development Instructions
This EMU Explorer repo is an Android Studio Project and App Module that can be directly cloned and imported into Android Studio. 

### Fork the repo
**Fork** the [Ecological Marine Unit Explorer Android](https://github.com/Esri/ecological-marine-unit-android/fork) repo.

### Clone the repo
Once you have forked the repo, you can make a clone

#### Command line Git
1. [Clone the Ecological Marine Unit Explorer repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#step-2-clone-your-fork)
2. ```cd``` into the ```ecological-marine-unit-android``` folder
3. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

### Configuring a Remote for a Fork
If you make changes in the fork and would like to [sync](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) those changes with the upstream repository, you must first [configure the remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/). This will be required when you have created local branches and would like to make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to your upstream branch.

1. In the Terminal (for Mac users) or command prompt (fow Windows and Linux users) type ```git remote -v``` to list the current configured remote repo for your fork.
2. ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/Esri/ecological-marine-unit-android`git``` to specify new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork. You can type ```git remote -v``` to verify the new upstream.

If there are changes made in the Original repository, you can sync the fork to keep it updated with upstream repository.

1. In the terminal, change the current working directory to your local project
2. Type ```git fetch upstream``` to fetch the commits from the upstream repository
3. ```git checkout master``` to checkout your fork's local master branch.
4. ```git merge upstream/master``` to sync your local `master' branch with `upstream/master`. **Note**: Your local changes will be retained and your fork's master branch will be in sync with the upstream repository.

### Configure Runtime Lite License (optional)
While the Ecological Marine Unit Explorer application references a Runtime Lite license file, it is not required to run the app.  To learn more about licensing your Runtime app, see the documentation [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-runtime/licensing/).  The Ecological Marine Unit Explorer is completely functional without the Runtime Lite license. We have used a Runtime Lite license to remove the "Licensed for Developer Use Only" watermark from the map since this app has often been used in demos. If you have a ArcGIS Developer account you can generate your ArcGIS Runtime Lite license and use the following steps to use it in your app.

1.  In the app modules build.gradle uncomment line 33 `buildConfigField "String" , "LICENSE_KEY" , LICENSE_KEY`
2.  Create a file named gradle.properties in the root of the project.  Assign your license key as a Value/String pair, e.g.: 

```
LICENSE_KEY="runtimelite,xxxx,xxxx,xxxx,xxxx"
```

3.  Uncomment line 104 in the MainActivity.java file that sets the license:  `ArcGISRuntimeEnvironment.setLicense(BuildConfig.LICENSE_KEY);`
4.  Sync your gradle file and re-run the app.

### Signing a release APK
- Create a file named `keystore.properties` in the root of the project. 
- Add the following content with your signing info: 

```
storePassword=myStorePassword
keyPassword=mykeyPassword
keyAlias=myKeyAlias
storeFile=myStoreFileLocation
```

- Open the **Build Variants** tool in Android Studio and ensure **release** build type is selected
- Click **Build > Build APK** and confirm that Android Studio has created a signed APK in the `/build/outputs/apk/` directory.
